## Features

This add-on provides a set of features to make the Volto block model 3 compatible with the Plone 6.0+ backend.

## Usage

Add this wrapper to the view of your block:

```tsx
import BlockWrapper from '@kitconcept/volto-bm3-compat/components/BlockWrapper/BlockWrapper';

const MyBlockView = (props) => {
  return (
    <BlockWrapper {...props}>
      <div>My block content</div>
    </BlockWrapper>
  );
};

export default MyBlockView;
```

It will add the usual `div` with the classNames `block` and the id of the block (e.g. `highlight`) for you.
You can also pass additional `className` prop to add your own classNames to the block.

If you add the `blockModel` key to your block configuration to 3, it will assume that you want to use the new block model so the block engine will take care of the rest.
It won't add the `div` wrapper and function in full block model 3 mode.

### `ExtraWrapper` prop

You can also pass an `ExtraWrapper` prop to the `BlockWrapper` component.
This prop is a function that takes the block's props and returns a React component.
There are use cases in pre-blockModel 3 scenarios where an extra container is needed.
This allows you to wrap your block in an additional component, where you define that extra container or also can be useful for adding extra functionality or styling.
If the blockModel is set to 3, then the `ExtraWrapper` prop will be ignored, same as the blockModel 2 wrapper.

```tsx
import BlockWrapper from '@kitconcept/volto-bm3-compat/components/BlockWrapper/BlockWrapper';

const MyBlockView = (props) => {
  return (
    <BlockWrapper {...props}>
      <div>My block content</div>
    </BlockWrapper>
  );
};

export default MyBlockView;
```

## Installation

To install your project, you must choose the method appropriate to your version of Volto.


### Volto 18 and later

Add `@kitconcept/volto-bm3-compat` to your `package.json`:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@kitconcept/volto-bm3-compat": "*"
}
```

Add `@kitconcept/volto-bm3-compat` to your `volto.config.js`:

```javascript
const addons = ['@kitconcept/volto-bm3-compat'];
```

If this package provides a Volto theme, and you want to activate it, then add the following to your `volto.config.js`:

```javascript
const theme = '@kitconcept/volto-bm3-compat';
```

### Volto 17 and earlier

Create a new Volto project (you can skip this step if you already have one):

```
npm install -g yo @plone/generator-volto
yo @plone/volto my-volto-project --addon @kitconcept/volto-bm3-compat
cd my-volto-project
```

Add `@kitconcept/volto-bm3-compat` to your package.json:

```JSON
"addons": [
    "@kitconcept/volto-bm3-compat"
],

"dependencies": {
    "@kitconcept/volto-bm3-compat": "*"
}
```

Download and install the new add-on by running:

```
yarn install
```

Start volto with:

```
yarn start
```

## Test installation

Visit http://localhost:3000/ in a browser, login, and check the awesome new features.


## Development

The development of this add-on is done in isolation using a new approach using pnpm workspaces and latest `mrs-developer` and other Volto core improvements.
For this reason, it only works with pnpm and Volto 18 (currently in alpha).
